# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-07-21 183144.jpg>)

I had some help with this from a TA during office hours and a Tutor.  The tutor really helped me FINALLY feel like I really understand local storage. Jquery made it easier and harder to do, but I do feel that I learned how to use it fairly well.  I googled often and understand how this all works together.  

There is a date from day.js at the top. 
The colors change with the the time of day, also from day.js
The code is written using javascript and jquery. 
I have made a unique repository name. 
The input taken on the rows is kept in local storage and presented on the page refresh.
The functions that need to be present on page opening are wrapped in the .ready method for jquery.
